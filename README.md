Mars Buttfield-Addison ([@TheMartianLife](https://twitter.com/TheMartianLife)) is a Tasmanian computer scientist and science communicator.

She is currently a part-time PhD Candidate in Computer Engineering at the [University of Tasmania](https://www.utas.edu.au/) and [CSIRO](https://www.csiro.au/), where she works to improve the accuracy, reliability and performance of radio/radar-based satellite and space debris tracking systems. In this capacity, she has worked with several research institutions and private entities to program or adapt instruments for everything from space debris and satellite monitoring, tracking asteroids, to measuring space weather effects, to communicating with planetary spacecraft. 

On the side, she does a bunch of other stuff including, but not limited to:

* writing books, such as the 2019 [*Practical Artificial Intelligence with Swift*](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/practical-artificial-intelligence/9781492044802/) and the upcoming [*Practical Simulations for Machine Learning*](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/practical-simulations-for/9781492089919/).
* running conferences, such as the annual AU/NZ Apple developer community conference [/dev/world](https://devworld.com.au) and the online conference [EveryWorld](https://auc.edu.au/everyworld/about/).
* creating STEM educational materials, such as the [Swift Rockets](https://secretlab.games/scienceweek/swiftrockets) code-along activity for National Science Week 2020 and the [Resource, Respond, Rescue!](https://www.corefoundation.com.au/gamification) Minecraft: Education Edition scenario for the CoRE Learning Foundation.
* serving on the board of industry bodies for the technology sector, such as the [AUC](https://auc.edu.au) and previously the [ACS](https://www.acs.org.au).
* working at the University of Tasmania's [School of Information and Communication Technology](https://www.utas.edu.au/built-digital-natural/ict) as a teaching assistant, research assistant, and private tutor. 
* speaking at conferences all over the world, about topics spanning machine learning, software architecture, big data analysis, and more.
* working with STEM outreach programs around Tasmania and beyond, to visit schools and run events and provide resources for children of all ages to engage with science and technology topics.

Much of her work is uncredited or under NDA—meaning the code available here is minimal—but she can usually be found helping out on whatever projects [Secret Lab](https://secretlab.games) or the team behind [Yarn Spinner](https://yarnspinner.dev) are working on.
