* creating STEM educational materials, such as the [Swift Rockets](https://secretlab.games/scienceweek/swiftrockets) code-along activity for National Science Week 2020 and the upcoming `[REDACTED]` Minecraft: Education Edition scenario for the [CoRE Learning Foundation](https://www.corefoundation.com.au).
* serving on the board of industry bodies for the technology sector, such as the [AUC](https://auc.edu.au) and previously the [ACS](https://www.acs.org.au).
